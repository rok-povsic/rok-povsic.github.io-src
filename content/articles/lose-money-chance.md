What is the percentage chance of loosing money at the stock market? Well, that
surely depends on the investment style and is hard to quantify. If you hold a small number of companies
in the portfolio, the chance of losing money is greater because if any single company performs badly,
the effect on the portfolio will be large.

But say you invest in a large number of companies, say in the companies of some stock index.
Well, we still don't know how those companies will perform in the future.
What we can do is we can look at how the one of the stock market indexes performed in the past.

The most data I could find, is for a stock index
[DJIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average).
The index consists of 30 large companies from the United States and I have data July 1896 onwards.
It is a good-enough heuristics of how the stock market moves.

Let's say you invested your money into the 30 companies of the DJIA index at some random point after year 1896. What's the chance your return
after some number of years is positive or negative?

Well, that depends a lot on how long you are invested. The common wisdom says investing in the stock market should be done for a long term.
Let's look at the data.

How about investing in gold? Below is the chance of losing money in gold, when invested for X years.

I have gold price data only from 1968 onwards so the maximum displayed number of years in position is 20.
