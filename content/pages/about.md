Title: About me
Authors: Rok Povšič

I am Rok Povšič, a programmer in financial sector, working professionally since 2007.

As a programmer I like to write clean code, one that is robust, maintainable and simply good to look at.
My IDEs of choice are Visual Studio and everything from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) combined
with the power of VIM by the use of various plugins (it's a killer combination, really). I am a Master in Computer Science
and am proud to say I was top of the class.

I like finance, investing and trading and am always trying to figure ways how to _beat the market_.

I also [teach programming](https://www.smartninja.org/) which is very enjoyable.

Besides being a polyglot programmer, I'm trying to become a polyglot for human speaking languages, although that's
progressing slower than I'd wish. Besides Slovenian and English I am relatively comfortable with German and am trying to learn French.

My other interests include playing guitar, working out, boxing, hiking
and reading books.
