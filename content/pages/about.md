As a Quantitative Developer with 10+ years of experience, I specialize in designing and implementing high-performance trading systems. The platforms and strategies I've developed have achieved high double-digit returns with strong Sharpe ratios, operating at latencies down to tens of microseconds.

My tech stack spans Java, Python, C++, Rust, C#, Linux, etc.

I've been leading high-performing development teams, handling hiring, technical management, code reviews, etc., while also contributing directly to drive projects forward.

Academically, I hold an MSc in Computer Science (graduating top of my class) and a BSc in Math and Computer Science from the University of Ljubljana, where I also served as a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms. Out of interest I've done extra coursework in finance, economics, and machine learning.

I like to write clean code, one that is robust, maintainable, and simply good to look at.
My IDEs of choice are mostly [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDEs combined with the VIM plugin (it's a killer combination, really).
