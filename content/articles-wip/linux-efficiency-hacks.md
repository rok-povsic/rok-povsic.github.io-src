Over the years, I've come up with a number of "efficiency hacks" that make using the computer as a software developer much more smooth. This involves

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

My observation is that efficiency of using a computer *is* important when it comes to programming. Even if the process of programming involves a lot (or even the majority) of thinking instead of typing, the ability to move these thoughts into computer as quickly as possible benefits. Anything th

Some of the tips here can only be applied in the Gnome environment, and some, more generally, only on Linux (sorry everyone else).

## Vim everywhere

I use Vim-mode in [the IDEs I use](/using-pycharm-without-a-mouse.html), in the browser, and in the terminal.

Most of the modern IDEs have some variant of a "Vim mode" or a "Vim plugin" (the JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, Eclipse, VS Code, Sublime, Atom). I find they do not always behave *exactly* the same as the original Vim, but in the majority of cases they do. Since usually some keyboard shortcuts conflicts occur between the IDE and Vim, you have to take some time to setup what shortcuts you'd want each to use. But once this is setup, the ability to transfer my thoughts into the screen quickly goes up by a lot.

I also use a Vim extension in the browsers I use (Firefox and Chrome). This makes it possible to browse without leaving the home row position, using K/J to move up/down, and using F (+ some key combination) to visit links. I've also added shortcuts ALT+H and ALT+L to move to previous/next page.

I've also have enabled [vi-mode](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_vi_shortcuts_in_terminal) in my Bash terminal. By default, you're in the insert mode, so it behaves as you'd expect, but you can go to the command mode pressing ESC. This comes in handy when there's a long command I'm working on.
