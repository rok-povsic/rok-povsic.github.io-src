Investing in stocks on a stock exchange is can be risky, especially when you're "in and out", i.e. involved only for a short period of time (short in this context being two years or less). The price movement of the instruments you're holding may in this period be such that you'll be tempted to do the worst: to buy high and sell low. Let's look at what you can do to defend yourself by managing the downside risk by being resilient do price drops.

I've already written about [what the changes of losing money in the stock market](/what-is-the-chance-of-losing-money-in-the-stock-market.html) are. Historically, the chance goes down with time. For each continuous invested year, the market, on average, market's chance of giving you negative returns goes down. But what if you would like to get some short-term profits and would prefer not to have the risk?


This can be avoided by covering your risk using a financial derivative called **option**. An option is a financial instrument that you buy for some price right now. This price is called the premium. The option *optionally* pays you some money in the future, depending on some stock market factors, but the nice thing is that you cannot *lose* money, besides the initial premium.

Each option has (beside the premium) some fundamental properties, which you all know in advance when buying the option:
- the underlying financial instrument - the option derives from this,
- the expiration date - when you're going to get paid (or not),
- the strike price - the price which is compared to your underlying instrument's price at expiration date,
- whether it's a **CALL option** or a **PUT option** - a call option pays you if the underlying's price at expiration date is HIGHER than the strike price, and a put option pays if LOWER.

When buying the option, you of course don't know what the price of the underlying will be at expiration date. But you are guaranteed that you'll either get nothing or get something.

Let's look at a practical example of an option.

Now, how can this be used in getting short-term profits? Firstly, we assume that over the long term, the stock market will go up, as it historically has. But if you want to be invested only for a year or two, this doesn't help you much since the prices fluctuation is big, and when you'll want to sell, there's a nice chance the price will be down. What if there was a way we could trade-in some of the potential profits of the potential price rise, for the drop in case the prices goes down.

Say we are invested $100,000 (higher numbers are more interesting) in MSFT, which is trading at $100 - meaning we hold 1000 shares. Since we'd like to sell this stock in a year on some date (maybe because we know we'll face some expense at that point), let's insure ourselves by buying a **put option**. 


## When to do this?

This strategy makes sense when:
- you know you're going to need the funds in short-term in the next 2 years; otherwise
- the current market prices are high and you have a hunch it's more likely to drop (though this kind of thinking can be dangerous),
 
Of course, even if your intentions today, with the cash you're going to invest, are that you'll buy the stocks you want to buy and hold them [forever](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-buy-and-hold-confession-2016-5), life circumstances may change where you'll be forced to sell these liquid instruments at an inconvenient time. That's why I'd keep some amount of cash in the bank account for emergencies to not be forced to sell anything at a low point.
