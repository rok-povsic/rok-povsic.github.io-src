Investing in stocks on a stock exchange is risky business, especially when being involved in it only for a short period of time (short in this context being two years or less). The price movement of the instruments you're holding will be such that you'll be tempted to do the worst: to buy high and sell low. Let's look at what you can do to defend yourself by covering the downside risk by being resilient do price drops.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I've already talked about [what the changes of losing your invested money in the stock market](/what-is-the-chance-of-losing-money-in-the-stock-market.html) is. Historically, the chance goes down with time. For each year you stay in, the lower the chance. But what if you would like to get some short-term profits and would prefer not to have the risk?

Even if your intentions today, with the cash you're going to invest, are that you'll buy the stocks you want to buy and hold them [forever](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-buy-and-hold-confession-2016-5), life circumstances may change where you'll be forced to sell these liquid instruments at an inconvenient time.

Emotions may also play with you. Assume that the what will happen is something like the following. The stock market is going to rise and rise. At some point, you'll hear that it's hot and you will want in the action. The price is the next months going to slowly and *inconsistently* go down. At some point, you'll think: *if I don't do something right now, I'm going to lose it all!*. You'll sell the instruments at the bottom, ending the painful period with a painful action.

This can be avoided by covering your risk using a financial derivative called **option**. An option is a financial instrument that you buy for some price right now. This price is called the premium. The option *optionally* pays you some money in the future, depending on some stock market factors, but the nice thing is that you cannot *lose* money, besides the initial premium.

Each option has (beside the premium) some fundamental properties:
- the underlying financial instrument (say MSFT, which is Microsoft's publicly-traded stock),
- whether it's a **CALL option** or a **PUT option**,
- the strike price,
- the expiration date.

Call options will pay you money **at some predefined date** if, on that date, the price of the underlying financial instrument is **higher than the strike price**. Put options act in an opposite manner: you get paid if the underlying instrument's price is **below the strike price**.

How can this be used in getting short-term profits? Firstly, we assume that over the long term, the stock market will go up, as it historically has. But if you want to be invested only for a year or two, this doesn't help you much since the prices fluctuation is big, and when you'll want to sell, there's a nice chance the price will be down. What if there was a way we could trade-in some of the potential profits of the potential price rise, for the drop in case the prices goes down.

Say we are invested $100,000 (higher numbers are more interesting) in MSFT, which is trading at $100 - meaning we hold 1000 shares. Since we'd like to sell this stock in a year on some date (maybe because we know we'll face some expense at that point), let's insure ourselves by buying a **put option**.
