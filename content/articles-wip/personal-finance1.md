In this guide, I will demonstrate from beginning to end, how to invest money in the stock market.

Why invest? Ever since around 2009 and 2010 the interest rates in the developed countries, 
which are set by central banks, have been very low, approaching 0% or even going into negative numbers. 
Since the commercial banks mostly offer customers only a little better percentage they get from the central
banks, the customers have gotten quite lousy deals, even when committing to deposits for long periods of time.

The central banks did that to stimulate their economies by forcing investors to look

Over the past several decades, the stock market has risen quite a lot. In the short-term, it's often been volatile, but if you have been patient and persistent enough, you could have multiplied the investment many times over.

What exactly does investing in the stock market mean? Does it mean buying mutual fund shares? Does it mean buying shares of specific companies? It means buying shares of at least 20 or 30 companies which is enough of a big number that you'll probably get a quite similar return to whatever the average market return is.

Because the stock markets are mostly efficient, meaning the prices of companies are where their "internal worth" is, it's easy for someone with limited investment knowledge to achieve average market returns. A little knowledge goes a long way, especially in personal finance. And since the average returns aren't bad (or at least weren't in the past), I strongly recommend to spend some amount of time educating yourself on it as you really don't need to know a lot.
