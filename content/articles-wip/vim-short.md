VIM is a text editor that makes writing code MUCH more enjoyable. Once you learn it you can't believe how people can code without it. It's like driving a new BMW opposed to an old Peugeot. Everything is just smooth and fast. And unlike BMW, it's free! Watching another programmer write code without using VIM is *almost* like watching your mother type two sentences using two fingers which takes 5 minutes. You just want to say: give me the keyboard, I'll do it for you. The programmer uses UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys, reaches for the mouse a lot, repeats certain actions a lot and might even know how to cleverly use HOME, END, PGUP and PGDOWN keys. But compared to VIM it's just sad.

The best thing about VIM is that you don't even need to use the original program! You just install a VIM plugin for your favourite editor (which exists for all major editors, including Visual Studio, all JetBrains editors, Atom, Sublime, ...) and you get all the functionality.
